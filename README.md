### How to Install
1. Download a release or clone this repository to your machine.
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod`
3. Create a folder where you will extract the mod into. You can name it whatever you like.
4. Open the downloaded mod archive, or navigate to where you cloned the repository, and navigate to the folder containing "descriptor.mod"
5. Copy all the files and folders inside of that directory to the mod folder you just created.
    - When you look inside of your mod/<folder_name_you_picked> folder, the `common`, `decisions`, `events` etc, folders should all be there
6. Copy the descriptor.mod file to `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod`.
7. Rename the descriptor.mod file to the name of the mod folder you created.
     - If the folder you created is located in `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\abc`, then you should rename the descriptor file to `abc.descriptor`
8. Open the descriptor file in a text editor, like Notepad.
9. Add the following line to the file at the bottom `path="mod/<mod_folder_you_created>"`
    - If the folder you created was located in `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\abc`, you would add `path="mod/abc>"` to the file.
11. Save the file.
12. Add "PotionSeller's AB Mission Pack" to your playset.
13. Enjoy
