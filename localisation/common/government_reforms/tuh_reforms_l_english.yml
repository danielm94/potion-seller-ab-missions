 dacian_elective_monarchy: "Dacian Elective Monarchy"
 dacian_elective_monarchy_desc: "The [Root.GovernmentName] of The United Houses of Dacia is born not of one will, but of ten. Forged in the struggle between the Voivode and the Boiars, this system enshrines the power of the great houses into the very foundation of the state. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wears the crown, but sovereignty is a shared burden, held in trust by the Sfatul Domnesc. The monarch is chosen from among the great families, ensuring that no single dynasty can claim absolute authority. To govern Dacia is to navigate a labyrinth of favors, rivalries, and ancient loyalties, where the greatest threat to the state often comes from within the council chamber itself."

 dominance_of_the_ruling_house_desc: "A state with ten heads is a hydra, not a kingdom. To govern effectively and project strength, the house of the reigning Voivode must be granted primacy over the others. Their will must be the guiding hand of the state, their resources amplified to meet the challenges we face."

 recognize_dniester_host: "Recognize the Dniester Host"
 recognize_dniester_host_desc: "The untamed lands along the Dniester are home to the Cossacks, fierce and independent communities of horsemen. By formally recognizing their Host and granting them lands and self-governance, we can harness their martial prowess as a bulwark against our enemies. In exchange for their service as the realm's premier cavalry, we must accept their autonomy, the loss of tax revenue from their lands, and the deep resentment of our own boyars, who see these upstart warriors as a threat to their ancient privileges."
 bulwark_of_the_faith: "Bulwark of the Faith"
 bulwark_of_the_faith_desc: "In a world of heretics and heathens, our Orthodox faith is our greatest shield and sharpest sword. We shall declare ourselves the ultimate defenders of the faith, placing the Church at the heart of our state. This holy alliance will grant us divine legitimacy and a zealous populace, but it will make the clergy a power unto themselves."
