 wallachian_voivodate: "Wallachian Voivodate"
 wallachian_voivodate_desc: "Though crowned by the Church, the Voievod of Wallachia rules only with the consent of the Boiermiea. To govern is to balance ambition against their ever-watchful eyes."
 wallachian_autocracy: "Wallachian Autocracy"
 wallachian_autocracy_desc: "Having decisively crushed the rebellion of the Ten Houses, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shattered the entrenched power of the Boiermiea and forged a new order in Wallachia. Whether through righteous defiance on the battlefield or by a singular, terrifying act of pre-emptive annihilation, the outcome is the same: the aristocracy is broken, their ancient privileges curtailed or extinguished, and their capacity to challenge the Crown utterly dismantled. Under the Wallachian Autocracy, all authority now emanates from the Voivode alone. The state is an extension of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] will, the Terror a finely honed instrument of control, and the path to absolute dominion lies clear. This is not merely a restoration of monarchical power, but its elevation to an unprecedented, unassailable peak, built upon the ashes of noble ambition and the fear of a cowed populace."
 appointive_voivodate: "Appointive Voivodate"
 appointive_voivodate_desc: "The disastrous outcome of the War of the Ten Houses has irrevocably altered the nature of rule in Wallachia. With the Voivode's power shattered and the Terror dismantled, the triumphant Boiermiea has ensured that no single ruler shall ever again wield such unchecked authority. Under the Appointive Voivodate, the hereditary principle is abolished; upon the death of a Voivode, the Council of the Ten Houses convenes to select a successor from among their ranks or other favored candidates. While this system may occasionally elevate individuals of notable administrative or diplomatic skill, it ensures the perpetual dominance of the aristocracy. The Voivode now rules at the pleasure of the Boiermiea, their authority constrained, their ambitions curtailed, and the dream of absolute power a distant, forbidden memory."
 dacian_kingdom: "Dacian Kingdom"
 dacian_kingdom_desc: "The proclamation of Dacia and the crowning of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] marks a new chapter, yet the ancient currents of power flow on. Though the Vlach lands are united under a royal banner, the Boiermiea of old, now Dacian nobles, still view their rights and influence as sacrosanct. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wears a crown, but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule over this vast kingdom remains a careful negotiation, balancing the aspirations of a unified Dacia against the entrenched privileges and watchful eyes of a powerful aristocracy. The scale is grander, the title more august, but the art of governance is still one of navigating the ambitions of the great houses."
 dacian_autocracy: "Dacian Autocracy"
 dacian_autocracy_desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Dacia reigns supreme. Having decisively crushed the rebellion of the Ten Houses, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shattered the entrenched power of the Boiermiea and forged a new order in [Root.GetName]."
