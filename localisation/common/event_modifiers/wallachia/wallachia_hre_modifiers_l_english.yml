 foolish_optimism: "Foolish Optimism"
 desc_foolish_optimism: "We stood for the preservation of the Empire while all others voted for its dissolution. Our faith in the old order has left us on the wrong side of history, isolated and appearing naive in the eyes of our newly sovereign neighbors."
 on_the_right_side_of_history: "On the Right Side of History"
 desc_on_the_right_side_of_history: "We correctly judged that the Empire was beyond saving and voted for its dissolution. This pragmatism has earned us the respect of our peers, who now see us as reliable and forward-thinking partners in shaping the post-Imperial order."
 legacy_of_failure: "Legacy of Failure"
 desc_legacy_of_failure: "The Imperial crown, a trust passed down through generations, was shattered in our hands. We presided over the final, ignominious end of Charlemagne's legacy. Our name is now etched in the annals of history not as builders or conquerors, but as the keepers who failed their watch. This shame will haunt our dynasty for generations to come."
 architect_of_sovereignty: "Architect of Sovereignty"
 desc_architect_of_sovereignty: "We did not merely win a war; we successfully dismantled a dying empire from within. By leading the secessionist princes to victory in the Imperial Schism, we have shattered the chains of the old order and established the principle of absolute sovereignty for all. Our nation is now seen as the primary architect of this new era, earning us immense prestige and a reputation as a formidable diplomatic and military power."
