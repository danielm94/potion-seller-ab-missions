 WAL_terror_state: "State Sanctioned Brutality"
 WAL_terror_state_desc: "To ensure order and obedience, the state itself has become an instrument of fear. Brutality is not merely tolerated; it is a calculated policy, instilling terror in our enemies and a grim resolve in our own forces. The Voivode's justice is swift, harsh, and an example to all."
 WAL_state_of_paranoia: "State of Paranoia"
 WAL_state_of_paranoia_desc: "In [Root.GetName], trust is a forgotten luxury. The pervasive fear of the Voivode's omnipresent agents and the ever-watchful eyes of neighbors eager to prove their own loyalty means loose talk can be a death sentence. Every citizen is acutely aware that any misstep, any unguarded word, could be reported. This suffocating atmosphere of suspicion makes it nearly impossible for foreign spies to operate; potential local contacts are too terrified to cooperate, and any outsider asking questions immediately draws unwanted attention."
 WAL_lessons_from_the_invaders: "Lessons from the Invaders"
 WAL_lessons_from_the_invaders_desc: "Centuries of subjugation and conflict under the Mongols, Cumans, and Magyars have been harsh teachers. Yet, from enduring the thunder of their hooves, Wallachian warriors have gleaned invaluable insights into the arts of cavalry warfare."
