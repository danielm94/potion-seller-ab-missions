 cb_depose_the_pretender_desc: "The German claim to the Roman Imperial title is a historical fallacy we can no longer tolerate. As the true successors to the Caesars, it is our right to correct this fiction. This war is a direct challenge to the pretender's authority. We will march on his capital not for territory, but to force his abdication and prove to the world where true Imperial authority resides."
