 incident_emperor_deposed: "The Emperor's Humiliation"
 incident_emperor_deposed_member_alert: "The unthinkable has happened. The armies of the Holy Roman Empire have been defeated, and our former Emperor was forced to renounce the Imperial title by an outside power. This unprecedented act of humiliation has shattered the prestige of the Imperial Crown and proven that the Empire cannot protect its own head from foreign aggression. In response to this crisis, the new Emperor has called the Imperial Diet to address a fundamental question: is our sacred union still viable? We are now called to cast our vote on the very future of the Holy Roman Empire."
 incident_emperor_deposed_emperor_alert: "We have ascended to the Imperial throne in the darkest hour of the Empire. Our predecessor was defeated and publicly humiliated, forced to renounce his title by a foreign invader. Faith in the institution is shattered, and the princes whisper that the Empire is a hollow shell, a weakness rather than a strength. To ignore this dissent would be to preside over a slow, agonizing decay. Therefore, we have summoned the Imperial Diet to confront this crisis directly. The princes must be given a voice. They will decide the fate of our ancient union: either we dissolve the Empire with what dignity we have left, or we reaffirm our bonds to face the challenges ahead."
