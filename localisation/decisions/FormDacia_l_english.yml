 wal_form_dacia_title: "Restore the Kingdom of Dacia"
 wal_form_dacia_desc: "The Vlach peoples are united, their ancient lands secured under our rule. The disparate principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania now beat as one heart. It is time to cast off the fragmented identities of the past and reclaim a name that echoes with the strength of our ancestors and the might of Rome: Dacia! By this proclamation, we shall forge a new kingdom from the old, a beacon of Vlach power and a testament to our enduring spirit. Let the Kingdom of Dacia rise!"
