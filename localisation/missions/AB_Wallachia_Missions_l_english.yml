 wal_call_to_arms_title: "A Call to Arms"
 wal_call_to_arms_desc: "The fragile peace Wallachia currently enjoys is a dangerous illusion. The shadows of Magyar ambition and Bulgar opportunism lengthen towards our borders, while our Vlach kin in Moldavia and Transylvania yearn for unity and strong leadership. To merely wait for the inevitable storm is to accept a future of subjugation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that [Root.GetName] must possess an army capable not only of defending our current lands but of projecting our strength to secure all territories vital to Vlach security and destiny. Let our neighbors know that the days of a passive Wallachia are over."

 wal_liberate_transylvania_desc: "For centuries, the Vlachs have been the subject of heathens, but this ends now. We must liberate our kin in Transylvania from the oppressive yoke of the Magyar invaders before they regain their strength and seek to conquer [Root.GetName] once more."

 wal_unite_the_principalities_title: "Unite the Principalities"
 wal_unite_the_principalities_desc: "Though brothers in blood and language, the Vlachs of Wallachia and Moldavia remain divided, their strength fractured, their lands a tempting prize for ambitious neighbors. For too long, this separation has weakened our people and invited foreign meddling. Moldavia, beset by its own internal frailties and the shifting allegiances of its Boieri, cannot alone secure the future of the Vlach nation, nor can it effectively contribute to the great destiny that awaits us if we stand as one.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that the time for two Vlach crowns is over. It falls to [Root.GetName] to forge this necessary union, to bring Moldavia into our fold, and to create a single, powerful Vlach realm capable of defending its interests and asserting its rightful place in the world. Whether through diplomacy, persuasion, or the unyielding might of our armies, Moldavia must be united with Wallachia. Only then can we truly claim to have secured the future for all our people and laid the foundation for a greater Vlach state."
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_title: "Liberate Dobruja"
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_desc: "For nearly a millennium, the Bulgar yoke has weighed upon our people. Their recent war against the Romans has left them overextended, their armies drained. An opportunity to settle old scores and secure our future now presents itself. We must strike across the Danube, seize their border fortresses, and liberate our kin in Dobruja. Let us shatter their frontier before they can recover and turn their predatory gaze back upon us."

 wal_unite_the_vlachs_title: "The Union of Vlachs"
 wal_unite_the_vlachs_desc: "The banners of [Root.GetName] now fly unchallenged over all the ancient lands of our Vlach ancestors – from the fertile plains of Moldavia and Bessarabia, across the rugged heart of Transylvania, to the strategic shores of Dobruja. The Magyar has been humbled, the Bulgar pushed back from the Danube. Our people, once scattered and subject, are gathered under one rule."

 wal_placate_the_boieri_desc: "The Boieri are the pillars of this realm. By fulfilling our obligations to them and ensuring their place within the state is secure, we can build a foundation of stability."
 wal_compromise_with_the_boieri_title: "Compromise With the Boieri"
 wal_compromise_with_the_boieri_desc: "Our attempts to placate the boieri have succeeded, but their loyalty remains conditional. To secure a lasting peace and bind their ambitions to the fate of the state, a more permanent arrangement is required. We must formally cede certain royal prerogatives, granting them greater power and security in exchange for their unwavering support."
 wal_the_great_feast_title: "The Great Feast"
 wal_the_great_feast_desc: "The boieri squabble over the carcass of the realm while our enemies sharpen their knives. Their constant feuding has left us vulnerable, inviting disaster. We will gather the Ten Houses for a feast, not of celebration, but of decision. There, we will make them an offer: end the infighting and forge a Great Council to rule as partners. We must convince them that a shared crown is more powerful than a shattered one. The future of [Root.GetName] will be decided at this table."

 wal_pontic_dominion_desc: "With the Principalities united, our gaze turns east. For generations, the Tartar hordes have been a scourge upon our lands, their raids a constant threat to our people and prosperity. The Golden Horde, though a shadow of its former might, still clings to the vital coastline of the Pontus Euxinus, strangling trade and projecting instability.\n\nWe must drive them from the shores of the Black Sea. By seizing the ports of Crimea and the vast steppes of the frontier, we will not only end the Tartar threat for good but also secure our place as the dominant power in the region. The wealth of the Silk Road and the security of our realm demand it."

 wal_worlds_desire_title: "The World's Desire"
 wal_worlds_desire_desc: "The 'Empire of the Romans' is a lie told by parasites in a dying city. For centuries, the clique in Constantinople has presided over nothing but decay. They disbanded their armies for profit, mothballed their fleets in cowardice, and watched as their lands were carved up by lesser powers. We will march on the City of World's Desire, scour the pretenders from its halls, and claim the title for ourselves."

 wal_drive_out_the_bulgars_desc: "Nearly a millennium ago, a curse fell upon the Balkans: the Bulgars. They carved an empire from Roman lands and have been a thorn in the side of our people for generations. Though their power wanes, their presence lingers, a persistent threat to our hegemony and a stain upon the region.\n\nWe must drive them from the Balkans and the Carpathians entirely, ensuring their kingdom can never again threaten our own. The time has come to finish the task and let the history books record that it was our hand that finally lifted this ancient curse."

 wal_conquer_the_serbs_desc: "The Serbs are fractured and weak, lying directly in the path of the Catholic powers.

 wal_conquer_illyria_desc: "The Croatian Kingdom has pushed its borders to the Sava, subjugating our Orthodox brethren in Bosnia. Their Catholic cathedrals rise over Orthodox lands, a clear challenge to our faith and a spear pointed at our heartland. Meanwhile, the merchants of Venice and Ragusa drain the wealth of the Adriatic coast, their fleets enforcing the Pope's will. We must shatter the Croatian yoke and drive the Latin powers from the coast."

A new vulnerability has been exposed, however, along the western mountain passes. The German princes and the Polish crown watch our ascent with avarice. Our nation's security cannot be guaranteed while these gateways remain in foreign hands. We must seize the lands of Transdanubia, Slovakia, and Moravia to establish an unbreachable frontier, turning the Carpathians into the impenetrable spine of our kingdom."

 wal_conquer_nicaea_desc: "The so-called Kingdom of Nicaea clings to its Anatolian strongholds, styling itself as the guardian of Hellenic honor and heir to a broken legacy. But there can be no compromise in the restoration of Rome. These self-proclaimed Exarchs are no more than rebels who defied their emperor and now defy us, the rightful inheritors of Rome.

 wal_conquer_anatolia_desc: "The secessionist pretenders in Nicaea have been dealt with, but the greater wound remains. For centuries, Anatolia, the heartland of the Roman East, has languished under the rule of Turkic invaders. The disaster at Manzikert was a mistake that bled the Empire for four hundred years. That mistake must now be corrected. The last remnants of the Sultanate and the myriad of beyliks that feed on the corpse of our legacy must be scoured from the peninsula."

 wal_conquer_antioch_desc: "For centuries, the sacred city of Antiohia has languished under the yoke of schismatics and heathens.

The time has come to restore Antiohia to the righteous fold and reclaim its rightful place at the heart of Christendom."

This nation of usurers has grown obscenely wealthy by leeching the trade of the East. Their entire city is a monument to greed, built upon the memory of their ultimate sin: the financing of the Fourth Crusade, an act of betrayal that shattered the Roman world. The Lion of Saint Mark is a beast gorged on stolen gold and Christian blood. It is time to settle that ancient debt, to extinguish their republic, and to drown the Lion in its own lagoon."
