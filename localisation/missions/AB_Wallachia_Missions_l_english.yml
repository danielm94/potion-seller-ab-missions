 wal_call_to_arms_desc: "The fragile peace Wallachia currently enjoys is a dangerous illusion. The shadows of Magyar ambition and Bulgar opportunism lengthen towards our borders, while our Vlach kin in Moldavia and Transylvania yearn for unity and strong leadership. To merely wait for the inevitable storm is to accept a future of subjugation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that [Root.GetName] must possess an army capable not only of defending our current lands but of projecting our strength to secure all territories vital to Vlach security and destiny. Let our neighbors know that the days of a passive Wallachia are over."

 wal_unite_the_principalities_desc: "Though brothers in blood and language, the Vlachs of Wallachia and Moldavia remain divided, their strength fractured, their lands a tempting prize for ambitious neighbors. For too long, this separation has weakened our people and invited foreign meddling. Moldavia, beset by its own internal frailties and the shifting allegiances of its Boieri, cannot alone secure the future of the Vlach nation, nor can it effectively contribute to the great destiny that awaits us if we stand as one.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that the time for two Vlach crowns is over. It falls to [Root.GetName] to forge this necessary union, to bring Moldavia into our fold, and to create a single, powerful Vlach realm capable of defending its interests and asserting its rightful place in the world. Whether through diplomacy, persuasion, or the unyielding might of our armies, Moldavia must be united with Wallachia. Only then can we truly claim to have secured the future for all our people and laid the foundation for a greater Vlach state."

 wal_strike_the_bulgars_desc: "For nearly a millennium, the Bulgar yoke has weighed upon our people. Their recent war against the Romans has left them overextended, their armies drained.

 wal_compromise_with_the_boieri_desc: "Our attempts to placate the boieri have succeeded, but their loyalty remains conditional. To secure a lasting peace and bind their ambitions to the fate of the state, a more permanent arrangement is required. We must formally cede certain royal prerogatives, granting them greater power and security in exchange for their unwavering support."

The Golden Horde, though a shadow of its former might, still clings to the vital coastline of the Pontus Euxinus, strangling trade and projecting instability.\n\nWe must drive them from the shores of the Black Sea.

 wal_persia_desc: "Alexander, Crassus, Trajan, Julian... the deserts of the East are littered with the ghosts of great conquerors who sought to permanently subdue Persia. For a thousand years, the Shahanshah has been our eternal rival, the one great power that has always resisted the might of the West.They believe us to be just another iteration of the Romans they have fought for centuries.

The vast coastline, reaching as far west as the Pillars of Hercules and encompassing the ancient Roman provinces of Africa and Mauretania, remains fragmented under petty sultanates and Berber warlords. These territories continue to threaten our new holdings in Africa. It is our duty to finish what our ancestors started.

 wal_coast_title: "A Window to the World"
 wal_coast_desc: "Our realm is defined by the mountains at our back and the great river at our feet. These lands are our strength. They are also our cage. Our trade is stifled by our neighbors. Our ambitions are limited by the horizons we can see. To thrive, to grow into the empire we are destined to become, we must break free of these terrestrial bonds. We must secure a port on the Black Sea. It will be our window to the wider world, a source of new wealth, and the birthplace of the fleets we will one day command."
