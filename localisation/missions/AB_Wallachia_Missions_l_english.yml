 wal_call_to_arms_title: "A Call to Arms"
 wal_call_to_arms_desc: "The fragile peace Wallachia currently enjoys is a dangerous illusion. The shadows of Magyar ambition and Bulgar opportunism lengthen towards our borders, while our Vlach kin in Moldavia and Transylvania yearn for unity and strong leadership. To merely wait for the inevitable storm is to accept a future of subjugation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that [Root.GetName] must possess an army capable not only of defending our current lands but of projecting our strength to secure all territories vital to Vlach security and destiny. Let our neighbors know that the days of a passive Wallachia are over."

 wal_liberate_transylvania_title: "Liberate Transylvania"
 wal_liberate_transylvania_desc: "For centuries, the Vlachs have been the subject of heathens, but this ends now. We must liberate our kin in Transylvania from the oppressive yoke of the Magyar invaders before they regain their strength and seek to conquer [Root.GetName] once more. The mountains call to us, echoing with the history of our ancestors and the prayers of our subjugated brethren. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead our armies to break their chains, reclaim these ancient Vlach lands, and ensure that the Magyar threat to our people is extinguished. This is more than a conquest; it is our sacred duty to see Transylvania free and restored to its rightful place alongside us."

 wal_unite_the_principalities_title: "Unite the Principalities"
 wal_unite_the_principalities_desc: "Though brothers in blood and language, the Vlachs of Wallachia and Moldavia remain divided, their strength fractured, their lands a tempting prize for ambitious neighbors. For too long, this separation has weakened our people and invited foreign meddling. Moldavia, beset by its own internal frailties and the shifting allegiances of its Boiars, cannot alone secure the future of the Vlach nation, nor can it effectively contribute to the great destiny that awaits us if we stand as one.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that the time for two Vlach crowns is over. It falls to [Root.GetName] to forge this necessary union, to bring Moldavia into our fold, and to create a single, powerful Vlach realm capable of defending its interests and asserting its rightful place in the world. Whether through diplomacy, persuasion, or the unyielding might of our armies, Moldavia must be united with Wallachia. Only then can we truly claim to have secured the future for all our people and laid the foundation for a greater Vlach state."
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_title: "Liberate Dobruja"
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_desc: "The echoes of Bulgaria's recent triumph over the Romans still resonate, yet our informants speak of armies depleted and coffers drained by their costly victory. This moment of Bulgarian overextension presents a fleeting, vital opportunity for [Root.GetName]. For too long, our Vlach kin in Dobruja have endured Bulgar misrule, their lands yearning for reunification. Simultaneously, the Bulgar fortresses across the Danube – Drastar, Turnovo, Nikopol, Vidin, and Negotin – remain a dagger pointed at our heartland, a constant reminder of centuries of conflict and a staging ground for future aggression.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognizes that hesitation now would be folly. We must strike while the Bulgars are stretched, before their victory consolidates into renewed strength aimed at us. By liberating Dobruja and seizing control of these critical Danubian strongholds, we will not only reunite our people and reclaim rightful Vlach territory but also secure our southern frontier definitively. The Danube must become our shield, not their highway for invasion. The time to act is now, to turn their costly victory into their strategic undoing at our hands."

 wal_unite_the_vlachs_title: "The Union of Vlachs"
 wal_unite_the_vlachs_desc: "The banners of [Root.GetName] now fly unchallenged over all the ancient lands of our Vlach ancestors – from the fertile plains of Moldavia and Bessarabia, across the rugged heart of Transylvania, to the strategic shores of Dobruja. The Magyar has been humbled, the Bulgar pushed back from the Danube. Our people, once scattered and subject, are gathered under one rule. \n\nYet, true unity demands more than conquest; it requires that these lands become an indivisible part of our realm, their hearts beating in unison with [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Every province must be bound to us not just by sword, but by law, administration, and unwavering loyalty. Once this final consolidation is complete, once all these territories are undeniably core to our state, then the time will be ripe. Then, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] can finally proclaim the restoration of a power that will make all of Europe tremble – the dawn of a new Dacia! Let us complete this sacred work, for our destiny calls!"
