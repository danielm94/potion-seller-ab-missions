 wal_call_to_arms_title: "A Call to Arms"
 wal_call_to_arms_desc: "The fragile peace Wallachia currently enjoys is a dangerous illusion. The shadows of Magyar ambition and Bulgar opportunism lengthen towards our borders, while our Vlach kin in Moldavia and Transylvania yearn for unity and strong leadership. To merely wait for the inevitable storm is to accept a future of subjugation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that [Root.GetName] must possess an army capable not only of defending our current lands but of projecting our strength to secure all territories vital to Vlach security and destiny. Let our neighbors know that the days of a passive Wallachia are over."

 wal_liberate_transylvania_title: "Liberate Transylvania"
 wal_liberate_transylvania_desc: "For centuries, the Vlachs have been the subject of heathens, but this ends now. We must liberate our kin in Transylvania from the oppressive yoke of the Magyar invaders before they regain their strength and seek to conquer [Root.GetName] once more. The mountains call to us, echoing with the history of our ancestors and the prayers of our subjugated brethren. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead our armies to break their chains, reclaim these ancient Vlach lands, and ensure that the Magyar threat to our people is extinguished. This is more than a conquest; it is our sacred duty to see Transylvania free and restored to its rightful place alongside us."

 wal_unite_the_principalities_title: "Unite the Principalities"
 wal_unite_the_principalities_desc: "Though brothers in blood and language, the Vlachs of Wallachia and Moldavia remain divided, their strength fractured, their lands a tempting prize for ambitious neighbors. For too long, this separation has weakened our people and invited foreign meddling. Moldavia, beset by its own internal frailties and the shifting allegiances of its Boieri, cannot alone secure the future of the Vlach nation, nor can it effectively contribute to the great destiny that awaits us if we stand as one.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that the time for two Vlach crowns is over. It falls to [Root.GetName] to forge this necessary union, to bring Moldavia into our fold, and to create a single, powerful Vlach realm capable of defending its interests and asserting its rightful place in the world. Whether through diplomacy, persuasion, or the unyielding might of our armies, Moldavia must be united with Wallachia. Only then can we truly claim to have secured the future for all our people and laid the foundation for a greater Vlach state."
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_title: "Liberate Dobruja"
 wal_strike_the_bulgars_desc: "The echoes of Bulgaria's recent triumph over the Romans still resonate, yet our informants speak of armies depleted and coffers drained by their costly victory. This moment of Bulgarian overextension presents a fleeting, vital opportunity for [Root.GetName]. For too long, our Vlach kin in Dobruja have endured Bulgar misrule, their lands yearning for reunification. Simultaneously, the Bulgar fortresses across the Danube – Drastar, Turnovo, Nikopol, Vidin, and Negotin – remain a dagger pointed at our heartland, a constant reminder of centuries of conflict and a staging ground for future aggression.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognizes that hesitation now would be folly. We must strike while the Bulgars are stretched, before their victory consolidates into renewed strength aimed at us. By liberating Dobruja and seizing control of these critical Danubian strongholds, we will not only reunite our people and reclaim rightful Vlach territory but also secure our southern frontier definitively. The Danube must become our shield, not their highway for invasion. The time to act is now, to turn their costly victory into their strategic undoing at our hands."

 wal_unite_the_vlachs_title: "The Union of Vlachs"
 wal_unite_the_vlachs_desc: "The banners of [Root.GetName] now fly unchallenged over all the ancient lands of our Vlach ancestors – from the fertile plains of Moldavia and Bessarabia, across the rugged heart of Transylvania, to the strategic shores of Dobruja. The Magyar has been humbled, the Bulgar pushed back from the Danube. Our people, once scattered and subject, are gathered under one rule."

 wal_placate_the_boieri_title: "Placate the Boieri"
 wal_placate_the_boieri_desc: "The Boieri are the pillars of this realm, not its enemies. Their loyalty is a resource to be cultivated, not a threat to be extinguished. By fulfilling our obligations to them and ensuring their place within the state is secure, we can build a foundation of stability that will outlast any single ruler."
 wal_compromise_with_the_boieri_title: "Compromise With the Boieri"
 wal_compromise_with_the_boieri_desc: "Our attempts to placate the boieri have succeeded, but their loyalty remains conditional. To secure a lasting peace and bind their ambitions to the fate of the state, a more permanent arrangement is required. We must formally cede certain royal prerogatives, granting them greater power and security in exchange for their unwavering support. This compromise will diminish the Crown's absolute authority, but will forge a new, more resilient political order."
 wal_the_great_feast_title: "The Great Feast"
 wal_the_great_feast_desc: "The boieri squabble over the carcass of the realm while our enemies sharpen their knives. Their constant feuding has left us vulnerable, inviting disaster. We will gather the Ten Houses for a feast, not of celebration, but of decision. There, we will make them an offer: end the infighting and forge a Great Council to rule as partners. We must convince them that a shared crown is more powerful than a shattered one. The future of [Root.GetName] will be decided at this table."

 wal_pontic_dominion_desc: "With the Principalities united, our gaze turns east. For generations, the Tartar hordes have been a scourge upon our lands, their raids a constant threat to our people and prosperity. The Golden Horde, though a shadow of its former might, still clings to the vital coastline of the Pontus Euxinus, strangling trade and projecting instability.\n\nWe must drive them from the shores of the Black Sea. By seizing the ports of Crimea and the vast steppes of the frontier, we will not only end the Tartar threat for good but also secure our place as the dominant power in the region. The wealth of the Silk Road and the security of our realm demand it."

 wal_crush_the_magyars_desc: "The Magyar yoke has weighed upon our people for centuries. Their kings claimed our lands, their armies bled our fields, and their ambition knew no bounds. We have broken their hold on Transylvania, but the serpent's head remains. So long as they hold the Pannonian Plain, they will plot their return and their vengeance.\n\nWe must march west, shatter their armies, and dismantle the very heart of their power. The Magyar threat must be ended, not for a generation, but for all time."

 wal_worlds_desire_title: "The World's Desire"
 wal_worlds_desire_desc: "The 'Empire of the Romans' is a lie told by parasites in a dying city. For centuries, the clique in Constantinople has presided over nothing but decay. They disbanded their armies for profit, mothballed their fleets in cowardice, and watched as their lands were carved up by lesser powers.\n\nThey are not emperors. They are squatters in the ruins of a city they have bled dry. We, who have forged a kingdom from the crucible of invasion and intrigue, are the true inheritors of the Roman ideal. The legacy of Rome is not a birthright to be squandered, but a mantle to be earned through strength and will. We will march on the City of World's Desire, scour the pretenders from its halls, and claim the title for ourselves."

 wal_drive_out_the_bulgars_desc: "Nearly a millennium ago, a curse fell upon the Balkans: the Bulgars. They carved an empire from Roman lands and have been a thorn in the side of our people for generations. Though their power wanes, their presence lingers, a persistent threat to our hegemony and a stain upon the region.\n\nWe must drive them from the Balkans and the Carpathians entirely, ensuring their kingdom can never again threaten our own. The time has come to finish the task and let the history books record that it was our hand that finally lifted this ancient curse."

 wal_conquer_illyria_desc: "The Croatian Kingdom has pushed its borders to the Sava, subjugating our Orthodox brethren in Bosnia. Their Catholic cathedrals rise over Orthodox lands, a clear challenge to our faith and a spear pointed at our heartland. Meanwhile, the merchants of Venice and Ragusa drain the wealth of the Adriatic coast, their fleets enforcing the Pope's will. We must shatter the Croatian yoke and drive the Latin powers from the coast. The lands of Illyricum will be brought under our protection, and the Adriatic will be secured."

 wal_conquer_greece_desc: "The head of the Empire rests in Constantinople, but its body remains severed. The lands of Greece—Macedonia, the Morea, the isles of the Aegean—languish under the rule of petty Latin crusaders, grasping Venetian merchants, and the scattered remnants of the old regime. These are not foreign lands to be conquered; they are the stolen heartlands of our Roman domain, provinces that must be restored to imperial authority. We will march south, sweep the schismatic pretenders into the sea, and bring the Emperor's peace to all of Hellas."
