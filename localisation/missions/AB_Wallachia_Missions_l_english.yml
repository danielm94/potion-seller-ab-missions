 wal_call_to_arms_title: "A Call to Arms"
 wal_call_to_arms_desc: "The fragile peace Wallachia currently enjoys is a dangerous illusion. The shadows of Magyar ambition and Bulgar opportunism lengthen towards our borders, while our Vlach kin in Moldavia and Transylvania yearn for unity and strong leadership. To merely wait for the inevitable storm is to accept a future of subjugation. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that [Root.GetName] must possess an army capable not only of defending our current lands but of projecting our strength to secure all territories vital to Vlach security and destiny. Let our neighbors know that the days of a passive Wallachia are over."

 wal_liberate_transylvania_title: "Liberate Transylvania"
 wal_liberate_transylvania_desc: "For centuries, the Vlachs have been the subject of heathens, but this ends now. We must liberate our kin in Transylvania from the oppressive yoke of the Magyar invaders before they regain their strength and seek to conquer [Root.GetName] once more. The mountains call to us, echoing with the history of our ancestors and the prayers of our subjugated brethren. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead our armies to break their chains, reclaim these ancient Vlach lands, and ensure that the Magyar threat to our people is extinguished. This is more than a conquest; it is our sacred duty to see Transylvania free and restored to its rightful place alongside us."

 wal_unite_the_principalities_title: "Unite the Principalities"
 wal_unite_the_principalities_desc: "Though brothers in blood and language, the Vlachs of Wallachia and Moldavia remain divided, their strength fractured, their lands a tempting prize for ambitious neighbors. For too long, this separation has weakened our people and invited foreign meddling. Moldavia, beset by its own internal frailties and the shifting allegiances of its Boiars, cannot alone secure the future of the Vlach nation, nor can it effectively contribute to the great destiny that awaits us if we stand as one.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that the time for two Vlach crowns is over. It falls to [Root.GetName] to forge this necessary union, to bring Moldavia into our fold, and to create a single, powerful Vlach realm capable of defending its interests and asserting its rightful place in the world. Whether through diplomacy, persuasion, or the unyielding might of our armies, Moldavia must be united with Wallachia. Only then can we truly claim to have secured the future for all our people and laid the foundation for a greater Vlach state."
