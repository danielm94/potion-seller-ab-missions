 tuh_faction_events.0.t: "The Brancoveanu Infrastructure Initiative"
 tuh_faction_events.0.d: "Representatives from House Brancoveanu, ever mindful of the foundations of our realm's prosperity, have approached the Council of the Ten Houses with an ambitious proposal. They advocate for a significant investment in infrastructure across [Root.GetName]: roads, bridges, and perhaps even new marketplaces, arguing it will stimulate growth and ease administration for generations to come. While the long-term benefits are clear, such an undertaking requires substantial upfront resources. Rejecting their vision, however, may not sit well with such an influential house."
 tuh_faction_events.0.a: "An excellent proposal! Let the building commence."
 tuh_faction_events.0.b: "Regrettably, the state cannot commit to such an endeavor at this time."
 tuh_faction_events.1.t: "Bibescu's Grand Reconciliation"
 tuh_faction_events.1.d: "House Bibescu, ever attuned to the delicate dance of diplomacy, has presented a bold strategy to the United Houses. They propose a sweeping diplomatic campaign aimed at mending fences and fostering goodwill with all our neighbors simultaneously. This 'Grand Reconciliation,' they argue, would significantly reduce regional tensions, improve our standing, and open new avenues for cooperation. Such an ambitious undertaking would require considerable diplomatic capital and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s full support. However, to dismiss this vision could be seen as a diplomatic misstep, potentially damaging our prestige and certainly offending House Bibescu."
 tuh_faction_events.1.a: "A bold vision for regional harmony! Let us proceed."
 tuh_faction_events.1.b: "Such a grand gesture is beyond our current means or focus."
 tuh_faction_events_1_tooltip: "Every neighboring country will lose §G5§! §YAggressive Expansion§! against us and gain §G10§! opinion of us."

 tuh_faction_events.2.t: "The Failing Angelid Line"
 tuh_faction_events.2.d: "News arrives from Constantinople. The [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle], [BYZ.Monarch.GetName], remains without an heir, and with each passing year, the future of the Empire is cast further into doubt.\n\nImmediately, the elders of your own House Cantacuzino gather in the halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They see this barrenness not as mere misfortune, but as a divine judgment on the Angelid dynasty's gross incompetence. They speak with cold fury of the mothballed fleets, the disbanded armies, and the starving populace of the Queen of Cities as undeniable proof that the Angelids have forfeited any right to rule.\n\nIn this moment of weakness, they present ancient genealogies, reminding you, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], that the imperial blood of Emperor John VI flows in your veins. The House of Cantacuzino has sat on the throne before; it is a legacy of rule, not of ruin.\n\n'The Angelid line withers on the vine,' their spokesman declares. 'We must not wait for chaos to consume the Empire upon [BYZ.Monarch.GetHerHis] death. We must press our claim now. Assert our right by blood and precedent, and prepare to seize the throne that they are no longer fit to hold.'"
 tuh_faction_events.2.a: "Our claim is just. Prepare the way for our succession."
 tuh_faction_events.2.b: "This is a vulture's gambit. We will not partake."
 tuh_faction_events.3.t: "An Unfinished Legacy"
 tuh_faction_events.3.d: "Constantinople has fallen, and the heart of the Roman world is silent. In Anatolia, the Hellenic Kingdom of Nicaea stands as the last major bastion of our people, yet its own future is now cast into doubt. The [NCI.Monarch.GetTitle], [NCI.Monarch.GetName], remains without an heir.\n\nThe elders of House Cantacuzino see this not as an end, but as an opportunity. They honor the memory of the hero Leon Gabras, but argue his independent kingdom was a tragic necessity for its time, not a permanent solution. With the Empire gone, this division can no longer be afforded.\n\n'The Roman world must be made whole again,' their spokesman insists. 'The Gabras family are kings, but we Cantacuzino are of imperial blood. The mantle of the Caesars defaults to us. It is our duty to reunite the Hellenes under a single banner and forge a new beginning from the ashes of the old.'\n\nThey implore you to press your claim on Nicaea, not as a conqueror, but as a unifier. To end the schism and restore the promise of a united Roman state."
 tuh_faction_events.3.a: "The Roman world must be made whole again."
 tuh_faction_events.3.b: "Nicaea has earned its sovereignty. We will not challenge it."
