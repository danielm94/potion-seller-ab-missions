 imperial_retribution.events.0.d: "Word has reached [Root.GetName] of the monstrous fate that has befallen our Emperor at the hands of the [impaler_country.Culture.GetName] Antichrist. The Empire stands leaderless, our dignity defiled, and our authority mocked before all Christendom. As the foremost prince capable of answering this outrage, it falls to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to rally the realms of the Empire. The princes must unite—not merely to avenge our fallen Emperor, but to defend the Empire itself from annihilation. Let the banners rise; let every sword and shield be brought forth, for if we fail here, all shall be lost."

Across Europe, banners are raised and swords drawn; they march not for gold or land, but for our annihilation. The war we have invited will decide the fate of our realm."

A new order rises from the wreckage of their folly, with none left to challenge our dominion."
