 wallachia_hre_events.1.t: "The Fate of the Empire"
 wallachia_hre_events.1.a: "The Emperor Can't Protect Us!"
 wallachia_hre_events.1.b: "Dissolving the Empire is Suicide!"
 wallachia_hre_events.4.t: "The Imperial Diet Votes for Dissolution"
 wallachia_hre_events.4.desc_majority: "The Imperial Diet, convened to address the crisis of our predecessor's humiliation, has delivered its verdict. The princes, having lost all faith in the strength and purpose of the Empire, have voted overwhelmingly to dissolve our ancient union. The Holy Roman Empire, which has stood for centuries as the heart of Christendom, has been undone not by a foreign sword, but by the votes of its own members. As the last to hold the Imperial title, it falls to us to oversee this final, solemn act. The crown of Charlemagne will be laid down, and the nations of Germany will now walk their own separate paths."
 wallachia_hre_events.4.desc_backed_down: "The Imperial Diet was deadlocked, with the princes of the realm split into two armed camps poised on the brink of civil war. In a fateful decision, the [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] refused to take up the sword against the secessionist faction, choosing to avoid bloodshed rather than enforce the integrity of the Empire. This act sealed the Empire's fate. An institution whose laws were not enforced and whose borders were not defended by its own head had lost its reason to exist. The loyalist princes, their cause abandoned by their protector, relinquished their allegiance. The Holy Roman Empire, undone by its own internal fractures and the inaction of its leader, is no more."
 wallachia_hre_events.4.a: "A legacy of centuries, ending in failure."
 wallachia_hre_events.5.t: "The Empire is Dissolved"
 wallachia_hre_events.5.desc_majority: "The votes of the Imperial Diet have been tallied. By an overwhelming majority, the princes of the Empire have chosen dissolution over continued union. The bonds that have held our realms together for centuries are now broken. The Holy Roman Empire is officially no more. Each prince is now sovereign, alone to face the wolves at the door. History will judge whether this was an act of liberation or collective suicide."
 wallachia_hre_events.5.desc_backed_down: "The Holy Roman Empire is no more. It was not undone by a vote of the Diet, but by the Emperor's refusal to preserve it. Faced with a divided realm on the brink of civil war, the Emperor chose to avoid bloodshed, and in doing so, abandoned the loyalist cause. His inaction has rendered the Imperial title void and shattered the bonds of our ancient union. Every prince is now sovereign."
 wallachia_hre_events.5.a: "Fools! Now we shall all surely perish!"
 wallachia_hre_events.5.a_backed_down: "The Emperor's cowardice has doomed us all. We were betrayed."
 wallachia_hre_events.5.b: "The Imperial yoke is broken. We are free at last."
 wallachia_hre_events.5.b_backed_down: "His nerve failed him. We are free without a fight."
 wallachia_hre_events.6.t: "A House Divided"
 wallachia_hre_events.6.d: "The vote in the Imperial Diet has failed to produce a clear mandate. The Empire is now split into two armed camps: those loyal to the ancient union, and those who demand its dissolution. Both factions are mobilizing, and the air is thick with the promise of war. The time for debate is over. As Emperor, the final choice falls to us: will we take up the sword to force the separatists back into the fold, or will we allow the Empire to break apart to avoid a catastrophic civil war?"
 wallachia_hre_events.6.a: "The Empire must be preserved. At any cost."
 wallachia_hre_events.6.b: "I will not drown the Empire in the blood of its own princes."

 wallachia_hre_events.7.t: "The Die is Cast"
 wallachia_hre_events.7.d: "The Emperor has chosen war. Rather than accept the division of the Empire, he has declared his intent to preserve the union by force of arms. The Imperial banner has been raised against the secessionist princes, and a civil war that will engulf all of Germany is now inevitable. A line has been drawn. Every prince must now declare their allegiance in the coming struggle. This choice will determine not only the victor, but the very future of our people."
 wallachia_hre_events.7.a: "We stand with the Emperor. The Empire must endure!"
 wallachia_hre_events.7.b: "The age of Emperors is over. We fight for our freedom!"
 wallachia_hre_events.7.c: "This is a war between brothers. We will have no part in it."
 wallachia_hre_events.8.t: "The End of an Empire"
 wallachia_hre_events.8.d: "The Imperial Schism is over. The armies loyal to the old Emperor are shattered, and the cause of Imperial Unity lies broken on the field of battle. Under our leadership, the secessionist princes have won their freedom through blood and iron. The Holy Roman Empire is now nothing but a memory. A new era of sovereign princes begins today, an era we ushered in. The future of these lands is now ours to shape."
 wallachia_hre_events.8.a: "A glorious new era begins."
 wallachia_hre_events.8_opinion_tooltip: "We will gain §G+50§! opinion and §G+5§! trust with every country that voted to leave the §YHoly Roman Empire§!"
 wallachia_hre_events.9.t: "The Empire Stands United"
 wallachia_hre_events.9.d: "The solemn verdict of the Imperial Diet is in. Faced with the question of the Empire's very existence after the recent crisis, the princes have overwhelmingly chosen unity over dissolution. The bonds of our venerable institution have held firm against the strain of humiliation and dissent. The Holy Roman Empire endures, its purpose reaffirmed by the loyalty of its members, and our authority as its leader secure."
 wallachia_hre_events.9.a: "A victory for reason and order."
 wallachia_hre_events.10.t: "The Empire Endures"
 wallachia_hre_events.10.d: "The votes of the Imperial Diet have been tallied, and our bid to dissolve the Empire has failed. A clear majority of princes have reaffirmed their loyalty to the old union, choosing the security of the institution over the sovereignty of its members. The Empire has weathered the crisis, but our position within it is now precarious. We have marked ourselves as dissenters, and the loyalists will not soon forget our vote."
 wallachia_hre_events.10.a: "A bitter pill to swallow."
