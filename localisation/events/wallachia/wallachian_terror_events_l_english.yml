 wallachian_terror_events.4.d: "The palace guards form a square around you and your family as you flee into the chaos consuming the streets of [impaled_country.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The air is thick with smoke, blood, and the stench of human waste. You begin to dry heave. Ahead, your guards march in blood-spattered armor. Behind you, your family stumbles in ruined finery — beautiful clothes soaked in mud and gore. The cobblestones beneath your feet are slick with a black, tar-like mixture of blood and soot. Bodies line the streets. Some are still alive. Hands reach from the muck, grasping at your legs, pleading for help. You stop looking down. Above, the impaled hang like ornaments. Their screams echo through the alleyways, nearly drowned out by the clang of [impaler_country.GetAdjective] steel as your guards clash with soldiers at every corner. Blow after blow, the formation buckles. You and your family are shoved, rattled, and pressed inward. The square tightens — tighter, tighter still — until it collapses into a triangle of flesh and shields. One by one, the guards fall. But by some miracle, what's left of them cut a path out of the city. You ride. You don't look back."

 wallachian_terror_events.5.t: "The Last Stand" 
 wallachian_terror_events.5.d: "The clash of steel echoes through the marble halls as fire and shadow devour the palace. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stands at the head of what remains of the royal guard, surrounded by family and loyal servants. There is no hope of victory, only the bitter resolve to die with a sword in hand rather than kneeling before the stake."

 wallachian_terror_events.51.t: "They Chose the Sword"
 wallachian_terror_events.51.d: "The enemy ruler refused to flee or surrender. Instead, they stood their ground and died fighting to protect what little they had left. While we were denied the spectacle of their impalement, the message remains clear: none escape the Voivode’s wrath."

 wallachian_terror_events.6.t: "We Got Away!" 
 wallachian_terror_events.6.d: "\"Right this way, everyone!\" Your family and court follow you toward the wine cellar, confusion plain on their faces. The screams of the dying and the thunder of cannon fire echo through the palace halls. You tell them to grab candles. Once in the cellar, you order the guards to move the giant wine barrel from the corner. It takes five of them. Behind it, just a wall. The men turn to you and wait. A pause. \"Well?\" \"Your Grace?\" says the head guard. \"Kick the bloody thing.\" He stares. \"The wall?\" \"Yes, the fucking wall! The secret passage isn’t inside the wine barrel, now is it?\" They begin kicking with their heels, but the bricks don’t budge. \"No, no — move aside. Bloody hell...\" You take a few paces back and charge, slamming both feet into the wall. The center bricks collapse, and you hit the floor with an undignified yelp. Guards rush to help, but you wave them off. \"I'm fine, I'm fine. Fucking hell... Kick down the rest of it!\" The bricks crumble, revealing a dank, dusty passage. It's pitch black, save for the candlelight. As you move through, the ground trembles with the battle above. Dust falls from the ceiling. One advisor turns to you, scowling. \"You had this the whole time and didn’t tell us? What if something happened to you? Who would’ve known?\" You smirk. \"Well, it wouldn’t be a secret passage if I told the whole bloody court, now would it?\" He shakes his head. You press on through the tunnel. At last, a ladder. You climb, push open the hatch, and emerge into a cow field. You head for the farmhouse. The owner is waiting — and hands you the horses you’d paid to keep there. You ride."
 wallachian_terror_events_impaled_escaped_secret_passage: "That thing was worth every cent!"
 wallachian_terror_events.7.t: "The Garden of Death" 
 wallachian_terror_events.7.d: "The screams echo even now, not from the city, but from the hearts of the people. Our ruler, [impaled_country.Monarch.GetName], and the royal family have been impaled by the [impaler_country.GetAdjective] tyrant. Their mutilated bodies hang as a warning to all who would stand against the [impaler_country.Monarch.GetTitle]. The court is paralyzed. The people are stunned. There is only whispers in the palace, and blood in the streets." 
 wallachian_terror_events_impaled_country_impaled: "God help us... What now?"
 wallachian_terror_events.8.t: "Paraded Like Cattle" 
 wallachian_terror_events.8.d: "Their boots took your dignity. Their hands tore the symbols of your rule from your shoulders. You were paraded through the streets like a captured animal, jeered at, spat on, and mocked. Now you return home, not as a ruler, but as a living insult. Your court speaks in whispers. Your rivals gloat. Even your allies avert their eyes. The stake would have been quicker, and perhaps, kinder."

 wallachian_terror_events.9.d: "News of the [impaler_country.GetAdjective] atrocity spreads like wildfire. The ruler of [impaled_country.GetName], a prince of the Empire, has been impaled, their royal family butchered before the eyes of the world. Whispers echo throughout : Where was the Emperor? The princes speak of oaths broken, of blood spilled with no response. Trust erodes. Influence wanes. The authority of the Empire weakens with every rumor, every sneer. We must answer for our inaction."
