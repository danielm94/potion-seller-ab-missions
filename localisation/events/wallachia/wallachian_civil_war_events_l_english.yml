 wallachian_civil_war_events.1.t: "The Boiermiea's Ultimatum"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.1.d: "Your Grace, I have received a troubling message from the Boiermiea of Câmpulung. It appears they are displeased with you rooting out the traitors and embezzlers in the noble houses — the bastards. I apologize dearly, and I do mean dearly for the wording of this letter sir, I... I'm sure you'll teach them all a very valuable lesson on respect, Your Grace... Erm.. Yes, the letter reads:\n\n\"Your Grace,\n\nIt has come to our attention that you have brought forward charges of treason and embezzlement against [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_accused_houses] Do you take us all for fools, Your Grace? Do you think we can't see what's going on here — your acting outside your purview? You know full well you are supposed to summon the Council for matters such as these, yet you acted alone anyway. [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_treasonous_relative] I have spoken with the heads of the other ten houses, and we have all come to an agreement. You will release all of the accused so that they may stand trial before the Council, you will restore all titles and estates to my late brother, and the rest of the accused, and you will agree to reparations for those who were illegally tortured and executed before they could stand trial before the Council. You have three days to send word of your response. Failing to do so outside of extraordinary circumstances will leave us no choice but to mobilize our forces and march on [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nGod save [Root.GetName],\nLogofat Radu Brancoveanu.\"\n\nHow shall we respond, Your Grace?"
 wallachian_civil_war_accept_the_ultimatum: "We cannot afford to have a war with the Boiermiea now..."
 wallachian_civil_war_reject_the_ultimatum: "Tell the bastards I'll have their stakes ready for them when they arrive!"
 wallachian_civil_war_trick_them: "Tell them I agree to their terms. Invite them all to a feast to discuss it further."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.t: "The War of the Ten Houses"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_refused: "As promised in their ultimatum, the Boierime of the Ten Houses have mobilized. Their banners blot the horizon, and their armies march toward [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with fire in their hearts and treason on their tongues. They come not to negotiate, but to dethrone. What began as whispers in Câmpulung has become a full-blown rebellion, and the nobility has cast aside all pretense of loyalty. The palace guard brace for the siege, and the streets of the capital grow quiet as the people wait to see who will rule [Root.GetName] — the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or the oligarchs who seek to wear his crown."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_banquet: "The garden is full now. Ten stakes, ten bodies — and ten noble houses with blood in their eyes. Word of the massacre spreads faster than the screams faded. Leaderless but not broken, the Boierime rally their banners. Sons, nephews, distant cousins — all cry out for vengeance. The war that now begins is not a war for power, but for reckoning. And they are coming for your throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Not to debate. To avenge."
 wallachian_civil_war_start_refused_option: "The traitors will drown in their own blood!"
 wallachian_civil_war_start_banquet_option: "Yes, come have a seat with your friends in the Garden..."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.9.t: "The Racovita Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.9.d: "Word has reached us that House Racovita has raised its banners in open revolt. Though not the most prominent among the boyar families, they have long resented our disregard for the Council and the impalement of their kin. Led by Mihai Racovita, they now march under the pretense of restoring tradition and justice — though in truth, they smell blood in the water and mean to secure a place for themselves in whatever follows."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.9.d: "House Racovita has risen in fury after the Banquet. With their patriarch butchered alongside the others, they have cast aside the trappings of diplomacy and rallied what men and gold they could muster. Ion Racovita, once a distant cousin with no claim to power, now proclaims himself the sword of retribution — and promises to drape the walls of Târgoviște in the Voivode's entrails. Another fire has been lit, and Wallachia continues to burn."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.9_option: "Let them come. Their blood will nourish the Garden."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.10.t: "The Movilesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.10.d: "House Movilesti has declared open rebellion. Descendants of an older order, they have long considered themselves guardians of custom and tradition. Vasile Movilesti, a stern old noble with ties in the eastern borderlands, now raises his banner against the Voivode, condemning the collapse of due process and the crown’s descent into tyranny. His voice may be aged, but the swords answering his call are many."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.10.d: "The Banquet has spilled over into the east — House Movilesti has risen in a fury of blood and fire. Stefan Movilesti, whose uncle was among the impaled, now calls for holy vengeance and the dethronement of the Voivode by force. Their banners bear neither plea nor parley, only black cloth and sharpened steel. One more noble house joins the war to decide the fate of Wallachia."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.10_option: "Let them follow their fathers to the stake."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.11.t: "The Mavrocordatos Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.11.d: "House Mavrocordatos has taken up arms. Long styled as stewards of governance and men of learning, they now denounce the Voivode as a despot who scorns the rule of law. Constantin Mavrocordatos, once an advocate of reform, now speaks of justice by the sword. His scribes draft manifestos while his bannermen march westward."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.11.d: "The banquet’s crimson echoes reach the libraries and salons of House Mavrocordatos. Alexandru Mavrocordatos, a noble of letters, has cast off his pen and taken up the blade. His father’s skull lies impaled before the family estate, and his reply to the Voivode’s treachery comes not as parchment, but steel. They rise not in petition, but in fury."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.11_option: "They will have their justice — and we will give it to them on the stake!"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.12.t: "The Ghica Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.12.d: "The halls of House Ghica no longer echo with debate — only the clatter of arms and the calls of marshalled men. Radu Ghica, ever the political animal, has cast his lot with the rebels, vowing to see the Voivode stripped of his crown. The House demands a reckoning for what they call 'the tyrant’s overreach' and mobilizes to deliver it."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.12.d: "The ghastly sight of Ghica elders impaled has ignited a fire in their blood. Andrei Ghica, once seen as a man of indulgence, now rides at the head of a column of avengers. He calls no council. He sends no letter. There will be no trial or tribunal — only steel and fire. The name Ghica now marches not as a family, but as a vendetta."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.12_option: "Let them come. We will add more names to the garden."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.13.t: "The Cantacuzino Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.13.d: "House Cantacuzino, proud and calculating, has emerged from its silence. Petru Cantacuzino denounces the Voivode as a tyrant and calls for the restoration of noble privilege and honor. Their forces rally with chilling efficiency — every levy called, every mercenary paid, every grudge remembered. They do not rise in haste, but with purpose."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.13.d: "When the heads of House Cantacuzino were dragged from the feast and planted in the garden, it was not just a massacre — it was a declaration of war. Gheorghe Cantacuzino rides under a banner stained with the blood of his kin. The house now fights with no demands, no petitions, no speeches. They march only for vengeance."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.13_option: "They'll join the others who crossed me."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.14.t: "The Craiovesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.14.d: "The old Craiovesti blood runs hot. Dumitru Craiovesti has declared that the Voivode has violated not just law, but tradition itself. In Oltenia and beyond, their banners rise — those loyal to old customs, old titles, and the sanctity of the boyar elite. They claim to fight for order, but they march for power."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.14.d: "They say the cries from the banquet chamber echoed through the halls for hours. Florin Craiovesti, heir to his murdered kin, now leads his house in open revolt. What began as a dispute over power has become a holy vendetta. To them, the Voivode is no longer a ruler — only a butcher to be brought to justice."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.14_option: "Let them choke on their ancestors' blood."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.15.t: "The Draculesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.15.d: "Sorin Draculesti — cousin to princes, heir to old battles — has taken up arms. The Draculesti banner now flies above rebel camps, its crimson bathed in the blood of pride and betrayal. They denounce the Voivode as a pretender, a tyrant who shamed their name by bypassing tradition and authority. Now they rise not only for power, but to reclaim their legacy from a crown they no longer recognize."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.15.d: "The banquet was supposed to be a negotiation. It became a slaughter. Vlad Draculesti, whose kin were among those butchered, has called for vengeance. His partisans whisper that the Voivode has forsaken Wallachia’s nobility, its soul — and now the House of the Dragon returns fire for fire. This is no longer a rebellion. It is retribution."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.15_option: "Let the dragons come."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.16.t: "The Danesti Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.16.d: "Incensed by your refusal to acknowledge the Council’s authority, House Danesti has taken up arms. Mircea Danesti denounces your rule as illegitimate and accuses the crown of trampling over noble tradition. Backed by disgruntled bannermen and lesser houses eager to protect their status, they now rally their forces in open defiance."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.16.d: "Barbu Danesti has emerged as one of the loudest voices condemning the slaughter at the banquet. He declares that no Voivode who butchers his guests can claim the Mandate of Heaven, and calls for your removal by sword and stake if need be. What began as outrage has now crystallized into rebellion — one that seeks to avenge the fallen and remake the principality in their image."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.16_option: "Let them come, and let them die."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.17.t: "The Basarab Revolt"
 wallachian_civil_war_events_refused.17.d: "For House Basarab, your refusal to heed the demands of the noble Council was the final insult. Long claiming ancestral rights over Wallachia, they now rise not merely to protect their privileges, but to restore what they see as their rightful supremacy. Their banners are unfurled, and their allies march with them — this is more than defiance, it is a bid for the crown."
 wallachian_civil_war_events_butchered.17.d: "The massacre of the banquet has thrown House Basarab into a fury. Neagoe Basarab accuses you of desecrating the very soul of Wallachia and swears to avenge the slain lords with fire and steel. His men gather in growing numbers, fueled by grief and righteous hatred, to challenge your rule and bury your legacy under the weight of noble blood."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.17_option: "Let them come. The stakes are ready."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.19.t: "The Proposal of House Racovita"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.19.d: "The doors to the throne room creak open. A courier from House Racovita steps forward — uninvited, yet untouched. Clad in modest silks with trembling hands, he bows deeply and produces a letter sealed with blood-red wax. 'My masters send their regards, Your Grace. They offer you a choice.' The letter is brief, written in a sharp and practiced hand. With titles now stripped of meaning and the gallows still warm, gold is the only currency left worth trusting. For the right sum, House Racovita will keep its swords sheathed and its banners furled. No loyalty, no oaths — just coin."
