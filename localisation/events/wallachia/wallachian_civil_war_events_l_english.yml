 wallachian_civil_war_events.0.t: "The Boiermiea's Ultimatum"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.0.d: "Your Grace, I have received a troubling message from the Boiermiea of Câmpulung. It appears they are displeased with you rooting out the traitors and embezzlers in the noble houses — the bastards. I apologize dearly, and I do mean dearly for the wording of this letter sir, I... I'm sure you'll teach them all a very valuable lesson on respect, Your Grace... Erm.. Yes, the letter reads:\n\n\"Your Grace,\n\nIt has come to our attention that you have brought forward charges of treason and embezzlement against [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_accused_houses] Do you take us all for fools, Your Grace? Do you think we can't see what's going on here — your acting outside your purview? You know full well you are supposed to summon the Council for matters such as these, yet you acted alone anyway. [wallachian_civil_war_events_boiermiea_ultimatum_treasonous_relative] I have spoken with the heads of the other ten houses, and we have all come to an agreement. You will release all of the accused so that they may stand trial before the Council, you will restore all titles and estates to my late brother, and the rest of the accused, and you will agree to reparations for those who were illegally tortured and executed before they could stand trial before the Council. You have three days to send word of your response. Failing to do so outside of extraordinary circumstances will leave us no choice but to mobilize our forces and march on [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nGod save [Root.GetName],\nLogofat Radu Brancoveanu.\"\n\nHow shall we respond, Your Grace?"

 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.t: "The War of the Ten Houses"
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_refused: "As promised in their ultimatum, the Boierime of the Ten Houses have mobilized. Their banners blot the horizon, and their armies march toward [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with fire in their hearts and treason on their tongues. They come not to negotiate, but to dethrone. What began as whispers in Câmpulung has become a full-blown rebellion, and the nobility has cast aside all pretense of loyalty. The palace guard brace for the siege, and the streets of the capital grow quiet as the people wait to see who will rule [Root.GetName] — the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or the oligarchs who seek to wear his crown."
 wallachian_civil_war_events.2.d_banquet: "The garden is full now. Ten stakes, ten bodies — and ten noble houses with blood in their eyes. Word of the massacre spreads faster than the screams faded. Leaderless but not broken, the Boierime rally their banners. Sons, nephews, distant cousins — all cry out for vengeance. The war that now begins is not a war for power, but for reckoning. And they are coming for your throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Not to debate. To avenge."
